# Random Connected Graph Visualizer
Generate and visualize a connected random graph of n nodes

This Python script generates a connected random graph with a user-defined number of nodes. The nodes are labeled with letters starting from A. 

Example:
python graph_generator.py 5 

This will generate a visualization of a random graph consisting of 5 nodes, labeled A, B, C, etc. 

The graph is visualized using the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.
